Tested on Arduino 1.6.11

A new settings.h file is available!

This Kaimana codebase is fully compatible with the Kaimana J2 LEDs and expects the following Wiring Setup:

KAIMANA->LED-P4->LED_P3->LED-P2->LED_P1->LED-K1->LED_K2->LED_K3->LED_K4 -> LED_JOY

Every LED except for the Joystick is a J2, meaning there are two LEDs per button. The joystick is a single RGB LED which can be ordered from PAS.

- Tournament Mode functionality
	- Hold HOME for about 2 seconds and you should see the activation/deactivation animation play
